Before you launch your first campaign, you'll need a reliable platform to send cold emails at scale. We recommend [Smartlead](https://smartlead.ai/?via=leadodo) â€” one of the top tools in the industry, outperforming competitors like Instantly AI.

## ðŸš€ Why Use Smartlead?

Gmail and Outlook have strict limits on how many emails you can send daily â€” usually around 20â€“30 per account â€” to prevent spam and phishing.

**Smartlead solves this by spreading your emails across multiple inboxes.**

For example:

> 20 inboxes Ã— 30 emails = **600 emails per day**, all compliant with sending rules.

This lets you scale your outreach without triggering spam filters.

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

2. Sign up for the **Basic Plan** â€” it's all you need for your first campaign.
