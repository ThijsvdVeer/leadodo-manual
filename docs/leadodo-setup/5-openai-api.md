# Step 5: OpenAI API

To use Leadodo’s AI-powered features, you’ll need to connect your own OpenAI API key. This key allows the app to securely access OpenAI’s models to analyze your data.

---

## 🧭 Getting Started

### 1. Go to the OpenAI Platform

👉 [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

---

### 2. Log In or Create an Account

- If you already have an OpenAI account, just log in.
- If not, sign up — it’s quick and easy.

---

### 3. Generate Your API Key

Once you’re logged in:

1. Click **"Create new secret key"**.
2. Give it a name like `Leadodo`.
3. Copy your key — you **won’t be able to see it again later**!

:::caution
**Important:**
Keep your API key safe and private. Never share it publicly.

## 💳 Activate Your Account

OpenAI requires a **$5 deposit** to unlock Tier 1 access. This is a one-time minimum to start using the API beyond free limits.

### 💡 Why this matters:

Leadodo uses GPT to analyze thousands of companies. For example:

- Analyzing **10,000 companies** can cost around **$50** in OpenAI usage.
- You only pay for what you use.
