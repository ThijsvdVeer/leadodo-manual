# Step 7: Warmup Inboxes

Once **Premium Inboxes** has finished setting up your inboxes in your Smartlead account, it's time to activate and configure the **warm-up settings**.

Warming up your inboxes is essential for inbox reputation and avoiding the spam folder. This step ensures you're starting your outreach from trusted, warmed-up domains.

## 🔄 Access the Warmup Settings

1. Go to **Email Accounts** in Smartlead.
2. Select all inboxes by checking them.
3. Click the **“Bulk Update”** button at the top.
4. Go to the **“Warm Up”** tab.

You’ll now see all the available warm-up configuration settings.

## ✅ Recommended Settings

- **Bulk Update Warmup Status**: ✅ Enabled  
  Set to `Active` to begin warming up.

- **Total Number of Warm-Up Emails per Day**: `40`  
  This is a healthy max limit. Don’t go higher unless advised.

- **Bulk Update Daily Rampup**: ✅ Enabled  
  - **Rampup Increment**: Set to `3` per day  
  This means your inbox will slowly increase the number of warm-up emails sent every day, starting low and building up.

- **Randomise Number of Warm-Up Emails Per Day**:  
  Set between `32` and `40` to mimic human behavior and avoid patterns.

## 📬 Reply Settings & Warm-Up Behavior


- **Reply Rate (%)**: `40`  
  This means 40% of your warm-up emails will receive automated replies to simulate natural engagement.

- **Daily Target for Replies to Inbound Warmup Emails**: `40`  
  Matches the number of expected responses — this balance is key.

- **Custom Warmup Identifier Tag**:  
  Use something like `Leadodo - Thijs`  
  This tag helps you filter warm-up emails out of your inbox view later + Using your company name and First Name will help with the trust score on these words.

## 🔧 Advanced Warm-Up Optimizations

- **Auto-adjust warmup/sending ratio**: ✅ Enabled  
  Smartlead will automatically optimize the ratio of warm-up vs actual campaign sends.

- **Warmup the Custom Domain Tracking Link**: ✅ Enabled  
  This improves trust in your tracking links before they’re used in real campaigns.

- **Send warm-up emails only on weekdays**:  
  You can leave this off.

---

## ✅ Final Tip

Even though Premium Inboxes handles the technical setup, **you are responsible for keeping the warm-up process active** until your inboxes reach stable sending volume.

Warming up properly protects your domain reputation and lays the foundation for a high-deliverability outreach campaign.

When finished, click **“Save Warmup Settings”**.

:::caution
The warm-up process takes **a minimum of 14 days** to complete — but if possible, we **strongly recommend waiting at least 21 days** before starting your campaign.  
Most successful agencies stick to a **21-day warm-up period** to ensure the best inbox placement and long-term results.
