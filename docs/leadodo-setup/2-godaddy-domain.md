## 🧾 Create a GoDaddy Account

1. Sign up for a **new GoDaddy** account.
2. Use a **generic but unique password** (you’ll use this account only for cold email domains).

:::caution

## 🌐 Register Your Domains

You’ll want to buy around **5 lookalike domains** for your brand.

### Example:

If your main domain is `tv-design.com`, consider alternatives like:

- `tv-studio.com`
- `tv-agency.com`
- `tv-web.com`
- `tv-dev.com`
- `tv-digital.com`

These will all be used to rotate email sending and avoid hitting volume limits.

## ✅ Clean Domain Best Practices

To keep your outreach clean, credible, and out of spam, follow these rules:

- **Stick to `.com`** whenever possible.📛 Avoid cheap extensions like `.info` or `.click`. These are commonly flagged by spam filters at Google and Microsoft.
- **Keep your domains professional.**It’s not just about algorithms — it’s also about human trust.✅ `john@tv-agency.com` feels trustworthy.🚫 `bobby32@getmoneyswagaccelerator-online.net` screams spam.
- **Avoid numbers, hype words, and weird symbols** in the domain.
  Clean and simple always wins.

Once your domains are registered, you’re ready for inbox setup in the next step.
