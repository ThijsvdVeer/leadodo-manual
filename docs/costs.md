## üìà Example: Scaling to Higher Volume

Once you're ready to scale your outreach, the **cost per campaign actually goes down** ‚Äî while your reach increases significantly. Below is a detailed breakdown of how the numbers look when you scale.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Scenario 1: 3 Campaigns per Month (30 inboxes)

With 30 inboxes and a conservative sending limit of **15 emails/day**, here's what‚Äôs possible:

- **20 sending days/month (weekdays only)**
- **15 emails x 30 inboxes x 20 days = 9,000 emails/month**
- Each prospect receives 3 emails ‚Üí **3,000 prospects/month**
- Leadodo is optimized to deliver **1,250+ prospects per campaign**
  ‚Üí So, you can run **3 campaigns/month**

#### üíµ Monthly Costs ‚Äì 3 Campaigns

| Item                    | Quantity    | Estimated Cost           |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Google Inboxes (GSuite) | 30          | $105/month               |
| Domains via GoDaddy     | 10          | $12/month (or $120/year) |
| Smartlead               | 1 Pro Plan  | $94/month                |
| SiteShot                | Lite Plan   | $50/month                |
| Apollo.io Data          | 3 campaigns | $150                     |
| OpenAI Usage            | 3 campaigns | $120                     |
| **Total**         |             | **$531/month**     |

üëâ **Average Cost per Campaign:** **$177**

üëâ **Businesses Contacted:** **3,750**

---

### üöÄ Scenario 2: 5 Campaigns per Month (Inboxes with Better Reputation)

As your inboxes warm up and build reputation, you may safely increase volume to **25 emails/day per inbox**.

- **25 emails x 30 inboxes x 20 days = 15,000 emails/month**
- ‚Üí **5,000 prospects/month** (at 3 emails per prospect)
- That gives you **5 full campaigns/month**

#### üíµ Monthly Costs ‚Äì 5 Campaigns

| Item                    | Quantity    | Estimated Cost           |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Google Inboxes (GSuite) | 30          | $105/month               |
| Domains via GoDaddy     | 10          | $12/month (or $120/year) |
| Smartlead               | 1 Pro Plan  | $94/month                |
| SiteShot                | Lite Plan   | $50/month                |
| Apollo.io Data          | 5 campaigns | $250                     |
| OpenAI Usage            | 5 campaigns | $200                     |
| **Total**         |             | **$711/month**     |

üëâ **Average Cost per Campaign:** **$142**

üëâ **Businesses Contacted:** **6,250**

## üìä Campaign ROI Potential

Let‚Äôs compare the return on investment (ROI) across different campaign volumes using realistic reply rates. On average, we see **1% to 2.4% Positive Reply (PR)** rates.

We assume each campaign targets **1,250 prospects**, and we break down the expected number of replies and the cost per reply:

| Campaigns | Prospects Reached | 1% PR | 2.4% PR | Total Cost | Cost per PR @ 1% | Cost per PR @ 2.4% |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----- | ------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| 1         | 1,250             | 12    | 30      | 256.50     | 21.37            | 8.55               |
| 3         | 3,750             | 36    | 90      | 531        | 14.75            | 5.90               |
| 5         | 6,250             | 60    | 150     | 711        | 11.85            | 4.74               |

üìâ **As you scale, your cost per positive reply drops significantly.**

---

## üí° Final Thoughts

Running 5 campaigns per month means contacting over **6,000 businesses** ‚Äî a volume that's nearly impossible to match manually.

**And here‚Äôs the magic:**
With a total cost of around **$711/month**, **signing just one client** likely makes your entire outreach effort profitable.

On average, you'll generate **60‚Äì150 positive replies** from highly targeted businesses with outdated or poor websites ‚Äî exactly the kind of leads you want.
