# Step 5: Copy Emails

Below you’ll find a growing library of tested email copy examples. These are real sequences that have been used successfully across different campaigns.

Feel free to copy, customize, and adapt them to your own niche and tone. But before you dive in, there are a few **important rules** you must follow to ensure your campaign avoids spam filters and gets replies.

---

## 📌 5 Rules for High-Deliverability Cold Email

### 1. ❌ No Links, Images, or Videos in the First Email

Never include **URLs, images, videos, or HTML formatting** in your first outreach email.

Mail providers like Google and Microsoft can’t actually “see” where those links go, which makes them a major red flag. Most spam and phishing attempts include these elements — so using them in cold email puts you at high risk of ending up in the **spam folder or being blocked entirely**.

### 2. 🚫 Avoid Spammy Words

Certain words and phrases (e.g., “guaranteed results”, “click here”, “limited offer”) will trigger spam filters immediately.

✅ Before sending, paste your email copy into this free tool:
👉 [https://mailmeteor.com/spam-checker](https://mailmeteor.com/spam-checker)

It will tell you whether your message is safe to send.

### 3. ✂️ Keep It Short & Scannable

People **scan** emails — they don’t read them word for word.

That’s why short emails often perform better than long ones. Aim for:

- **70–175 words** max
- Clean formatting
- 1 call to action (e.g., “Would you be open to a quick call?”)

### 🌀 Use Spintax for Maximum Variation

Using spintax (randomized word/phrase variations) is one of the best ways to increase the deliverability and longevity of your cold email copy.

Smartlead automatically rotates the words or phrases you place inside brackets like this:

```text
Hi {Hey|Hello|Hi there} {John|Sarah|Alex},
```

This means every prospect receives a slightly different version of your message — reducing the risk of being flagged as bulk or spam.

The more spintaxes you use, the more unique variations are generated.
Example 1, has over 87 billion unique combinations.

🧠 Tip: Use spintax in subject lines, greetings, and opening lines — but always test your copy to ensure it still reads naturally.

### 5. 🎯 Reference Pain Points or Case Studies (When Relevant)

Mentioning a relevant result, insight, or case study can help build trust — but make sure it aligns with your prospect's pain points.

Understand your audience first. A generic stat won’t impress anyone unless it speaks directly to their situation.

## 📬 Email Templates & Best Practices

All email sequences are structured by type:

* 📨 Initial Outreach
* 🔁 Follow-Up
* 🔔 Final Reminder

You’ll find multiple examples for each, which you can copy, paste, and adapt.

### 📨 Subject Lines (for Initial Email Only)

Subject lines are only used in the first email — follow-ups (Email 2 and 3) should not include a subject line so replies stay in the same thread.

Here are a few example formats:

```text
Website {{first_name}}?
{{company_name}} x [YourName]
Better website {{company_name}}?
{{first_name}} x {{company_name}}
```

Keep them short and curiosity-driven

### 📅 Email Sending Rules

Send only 3 emails per lead

In Smartlead, press “Add Step” to add follow-ups

Recommended timing between emails:

* Step 1 → Step 2 (Follow-Up): wait 4 days
* Step 2 → Step 3 (Final Reminder): wait 5 days

This pacing helps maintain deliverability and gives prospects time to respond without pressure.

### ✅ Completed
Once you've added your 3 email steps and given your campaign a name (top left), simply click “Save & Next” in the bottom right corner to continue.
