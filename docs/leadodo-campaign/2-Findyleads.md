# Step 2: Findyleads

Now that your Apollo.io search is ready, it’s time to **export the list into a spreadsheet** that you can use in Leadodo’s campaign builder.

We'll use a tool called **Findyleads** to do this. It’s one of the easiest and most reliable ways to export and verify leads from Apollo.

---

## 🧠 Why Use Findyleads?

There are many ways to extract data from Apollo, but Findyleads offers:

- ✅ Easy-to-use interface  
- 🧼 **Automatic email verification** with MillionVerifier  
- 📊 Clean, ready-to-import spreadsheets  

---

## 📬 What is Email Verification (and Why It Matters)?

When you send cold emails, **you want to avoid bounces at all costs**.

There are a few types of risky emails:

- **Hard bounce** – the address doesn't exist
- **Soft bounce** – temporary issue (e.g. full inbox)
- **Catch-all** – a domain that accepts all emails (some may still fail)

Too many bounces = your sender reputation tanks, and **your emails go straight to spam**.

💡 That’s why every lead list should be **verified before use** — and Findyleads takes care of this for you automatically.

## 🔄 How to Export Your Apollo List

### 1. Copy Your Apollo Search URL

From Step 1, copy the **exact URL** of your filtered Apollo lead list (make sure it still shows the same results you want to export).

---

### 2. Go to Findyleads

👉 Visit: [https://findylead.com/apollo-leads/](https://findylead.com/apollo-leads/)

You’ll see two export options:

1. **Export Apollo People**  
2. **Apollo Leads Verified With MillionVerifier** ✅ (this is the one you want)

---

### 3. Choose the Verified Option

Click on **“Apollo Leads Verified With MillionVerifier”**.

- Fill out your details (name, email, etc.)
- Paste your Apollo search URL
- Submit the form

💵 The correct price should be **$49.99**.  
If you see a lower price (like $30), you’ve likely selected the wrong option — and **email verification is not included**.

---

### 4. Wait for Delivery

Your verified lead list will be delivered to your email within **4–8 hours**.

The file will be in CSV format — ready to upload directly into Leadodo’s application.

---

## ✅ You’re Done!

You’ve now ordered your first **verified, high-quality lead list** — clean, safe, and ready to use.

👉 In the next step, we’ll upload it into Leadodo and begin preparing your campaign.
