# Step 1: Apollo.io

Apollo.io is one of the most powerful B2B lead databases in the world. It gives you access to millions of verified contacts, making it the perfect place to build high-quality lead lists for your Leadodo campaigns.

---

## 🚀 Why Use Apollo?

- ✅ Access to **millions of up-to-date, verified business contacts**
- 🔍 Powerful filtering options to target **exactly the right companies**
- 🥇 Currently considered the **most accurate** and complete database in the cold outreach space

---

## 🛠 Getting Started with Apollo

### 1. Create a Free Apollo Account

👉 Visit: [https://www.apollo.io](https://www.apollo.io)

- Sign up for a free account — no credit card needed
- You won’t be able to export leads directly in bulk from Apollo — that’s why we’ll use a workaround in the next step

---

### 2. Use Apollo Filters to Build Your Lead List

:::caution
**Important:**
Click on **“People”** in the top bar, and then choose **“Net New”**.
This is where you’ll apply the filters to create your lead list.
:::

Below are the most important filters to apply:

---

### 🌍 Location

Select the **country or region** you want to target.

- If you're working locally, choose your own country.
- Leadodo supports **all languages**, so feel free to target non-English-speaking countries — they often yield **better reply rates** due to less competition in cold outreach.
- You can choose from multiple areas at once.

---

### 🏢 Industry

Choose industries where businesses depend on having a good online presence and typically have a decent marketing budget.

Examples:

- Local businesses: dentists, home services, physiotherapists
- B2B companies: manufacturers, software firms, logistics
- Avoid micro-scale businesses where budget may be too tight (e.g. small cafés or hobby stores)

💡 A manufacturing company usually has a higher budget than a massage salon — so filter accordingly to your target client type.

---

### 👥 Employee Count

Use this to target companies of the right size:

- **1–50 employees** is often a good sweet spot
- If you're used to working with larger companies, adjust accordingly
- Avoid companies with **100+ employees** unless you're targeting corporate clients — larger companies often have in-house web teams

---

### 🧑 Job Titles

Select who you want to contact. Go for decision-makers such as:

- **Founder**
- **Owner**
- **Marketing Manager**
- **Director**
- **Co-Founder**
- **CEO**
- **C-Suite**
- **Marketing Director**

🌍 **Tip:** If you’re targeting a **non-English-speaking country**, use native job titles as well.
For example, in the Netherlands, add **“Eigenaar”** next to “Owner”.

---

### 🧪 Requirements before export

If you're more experienced with Apollo, you can also explore:

- **Email Status** – Verified & Uverified, do not select Unavailable
- **Minimum Number of People** – You need atleast 20.000 people in your list before you can export, otherwise you may encounter lesser prospects after exporting

---

### ✅ Your List Is Ready!

Once you've applied all the filters and reviewed your results:

➡️ Copy the **URL** of your Apollo search


➡️ Head over to the next step to **extract the lead data using Findyleads**
