# Step 4: Import into Smartlead

Now that your analysis is complete and you have your `Leadodo-final.csv` file ready, it’s time to upload it into **Smartlead** to launch your cold outreach campaign.

This step is quick and straightforward.

:::caution
**Important:**  
Before importing your list into Smartlead, make absolutely sure your CSV contains **only verified “good” emails**.  

Using unverified, risky, or invalid emails can result in high bounce rates — which will damage your inbox reputation and get your domain flagged.  

If you haven’t verified your list yet, go back to [Step 2-1: MillionVerifier](/docs/leadodo-campaign/2-1-million-verifier) before continuing.
