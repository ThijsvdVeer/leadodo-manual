# 3. Permium inboxes

Next up, purchase your Google Workspace email accounts. We use Google because it delivers the best inbox placementâ€”meaning more of your emails land in your contacts' primary inbox rather than the spam folder. This is key in lead generation.

Each account costs about $6 to $8 normally, but we work with trusted Google Resellers to make setup easy. Follow their instructions to get your accounts up and running. Our Google Reseller is called Premium Inboxes where each account only cost $3,5 per account while they also do all the work as adding Complete technical setup (DKIM, DMARC, MX Records, SPF, Custom Domain Tracking, and Domain Forwarding).
