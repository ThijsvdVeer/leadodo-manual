# 3. Permium Inboxes

Next up, purchase your Google Workspace email accounts. We use Google because it delivers the best inbox placementâ€”meaning more of your emails land in your contacts' primary inbox rather than the spam folder. This is key in lead generation.

Each account costs about $6 to $8 normally, but we work with trusted Google Resellers to make setup easy. Follow their instructions to get your accounts up and running. Our Google Reseller is called [Premium Inboxes](https://premiuminboxes.com?fpr=leadodo) where each account only cost $3,5 per account while they also do all the work as adding **Complete technical setup** (DKIM, DMARC, MX Records, SPF, Custom Domain Tracking, and Domain Forwarding).
