# 2. GoDaddy Domain Setup

Your next step is to secure your domains through GoDaddy. Follow these instructions.

## Create a New Account

Sign up for a **new** GoDaddy account. Be sure to set a **generic, unique password** for this account.

## Register Your Domains

Choose **5**, lookalike domain names. For example, if your primary domain is **Dazze.Studio**, choose domains such as:

* dazze-studio.com
* dazze-agency.com
* dazze-web.com
* dazze-design.com
* dazze-dev.com

## Keep It Trustworthy

Use domains with a .com or .co extension and avoid overly long names to ensure they look professional.
