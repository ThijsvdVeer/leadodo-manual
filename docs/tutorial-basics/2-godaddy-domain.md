## Create a New Account

Sign up for a **new GoDaddy** account. Be sure to set a **generic, unique password** for this account.

:::caution

Using GoDaddy is very important

## Register Your Domains

Choose **5**, lookalike domain names. For example, if your primary domain is **tv-design.com**, choose domains such as:

* **tv-studio.com**
* **tv-agency.com**
* **tv-web.com**
* **tv-studio.com**
* **tv-dev.com**

## Setting up a clean deployment:

* **Invest in .com** domains or the best available alternative only.
  * Buying a cheap extension like `.info` or `.click` may seem like a savvy purchase until you find out the AI machine learning filters at Google and Microsoft know the highest spam volume comes from the cheapest domains and then sentence yours to the spam folder.
* **Keep domains classy.**
  * How a address looks does not have a direct effect on deliverability.
  * However, if your senders look something like `bobby32@getmoneyswagaccelerator-online.net` people will get the ick and be more prone to distrusting you.
  * That means you lost the click and the algos at Google and Microsoft will think you're sending undesirable unsolicited mail.
