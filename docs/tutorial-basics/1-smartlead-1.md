# 1. Smartlead

[Visit Smartlead](https://smartlead.ai/?via=leadodo)

Let's kick things off by setting up your [Smartlead](https://smartlead.ai/?via=leadodo) account. Before launching your first campaign, you'll need the right tools to send emails effectively. Smartlead is our choice because they're leaders in cold email solutions, delivering top-notch performance. Outpacing competitors like Instantly AI.

## Why Use an External Tool?

Gmail and Outlook are constantly tightening their filters to block spam and phishing. This is smart, but it also limits how many emails you can send. Instead of manually sending 20–30 emails a day from one account, Smartlead lets you send the same email from multiple accounts. For example, 20 accounts sending 30 emails each equals 600 emails daily—without breaking any rules.

## Getting Started

Create an account (Min. Basic Plan): [Smartlead (Clickable)](https://smartlead.ai/?via=leadodo)

**Important:** Create a generic, unique password for your Smartlead account. We’ll need to share this with another company later on.

For your first campaign, the **Basic Plan** is all you need. Once you complete your initial campaign, you’ll likely want to upgrade to the Pro Plan as your needs grow.
